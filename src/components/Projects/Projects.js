              title="LAVA Voice Assistant"
              description="Enhanced LAVAâ€™s voice assistant technology by improving voice recognition and response accuracy. I worked on improving voice recognition accuracy and developed better response algorithms. This provided me with hands-on experience in AI, natural language processing, and voice interaction systems, focusing on providing a seamless user experience. This project also involved working with speech-to-text and natural language understanding systems to improve the overall interaction."

              title="Federated Learning Project"
              description="In this project, I developed a federated learning model aimed at secure and distributed healthcare applications. I focused on ensuring data privacy while enabling collaborative model training across multiple clients. The model was designed to train on distributed data without the need to centralize sensitive information, leveraging federated averaging techniques to optimize model accuracy. This was an important step toward creating more secure and privacy-preserving machine learning models."
